Browse - GET - /smartlist - to view all the tasks

<!-- Read - GET - /smartlist/:id --> Not required unless each task is editable

Edit - POST (\*PUT/PATCH) - /smartlist/:id - change categories
Add - POST - /smartlist - add tasks
Delete - POST (\*DELETE) - /smartlist/:id/delete - delete tasks

What would the :id be for in this case? Would it be for the todos.id?
Is edit route required to change categories? to change categories yes
