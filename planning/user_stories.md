<!-- As a \_**\_, I want to \_\_\_**, because \_\_\_\_. -->

1. As a user, I want to add a to do task, because I would like to remember it AND it updates a category on the UI.
2. As a user, I want to be able to change categories, because it might not have a category or was miscategorized AND this moves the task to another category.
3. As a user, I want to be able to edit, because I may have made a mistake when adding the task AND it updates the category.
4. As a user, I want to be able to delete tasks, because I finished the task AND it removes the task from the list.
5. As a user, I want to only access my own tasks, because of privacy.
6. As a user, I want to mark important tasks, because I can prioritize them AND it adds something to show this (star?).
7. As a user, I want to be able to priotize my tasks within the categories, because it gives allows me to choose which one to do first AND this updates the tasks.
