# Smartodo Project

Smartodo is a full stack todo list application that is able to categorize added tasks. It was made using EJS, sass, JS, jQuery/AJAX, Axios, Node.js and postgreSQL. External APIs used were: Advanced Movie Search API, HAPI Books API and the Edamam Food and Grocery Database API. Midterm project for Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp

# Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

# Contributions

## My Contributions

- All database tables and seeds setup, queries on server side
- Overall page routing between server and client side (logic, data movement/manipulation, and implementation)
  - Includes login and register functionalities, persisting cookie data
- Axios implementation to move external API calls to server side (initially set up client side)
- Find sources for all external APIs and implement them
- Views setup and styling for all rendered pages - landing page, forms, partials header, etc
  - Includes most styling (such as bouncing nav bar items and spinner modal) as well as functionality for all requests from these pages
- Site functionality: addition of new tasks, deletion, login/logout, registration and correct database manipulation to allow for these functions
- All site links for ease of navigation
- Separate all styles into separate files using middleware provided
- Consistently refactor code
- Do code clean up
- Make site mobile responsive
